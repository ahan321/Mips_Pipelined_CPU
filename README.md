# Mips_Pipelined_CPU
This is a 5-staged MIPS pipelined CPU that I created for my Computer Organization &amp; Design Class using Xilinx Vivado.  It incorporates branch delays and forwarding.

##Accessing the Code
The easiest way to access code that isn't boilerplate is to press the "Verilog" button under "Languages."  All Verilog files in this project are custom and represent synthesizable code.

##Opening the Project
In order for the project to be synthesizable, it must be opened with [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html).  Please note that Xilinx Vivado is subject to export restrictions to certain countries.
